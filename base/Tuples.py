# Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed).
# Also, they are created using parentheses, rather than square brackets.

words = (1,2,"hello","dog")
print(words[1])

# An empty tuple is created using an empty parenthesis pair.
words = ()
print("word:")
print(words)

words = ("new1","new2")
